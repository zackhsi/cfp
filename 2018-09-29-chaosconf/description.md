Over the past several years, Lyft has matured from a scrappy, outage-prone startup into a reliable transportation-as-a-service platform. How did this happen? _Incrementally_, with deliberate forward-looking decisions and tradeoffs.

In this talk, I will describe Lyft's path towards reliability, highlighting how the principles of chaos engineering have helped us maintain resilient distributed systems. Purpose-built systems to manage chaos have enabled us to carefully familiarize ourselves with the edge of chaos. There will, of course, be war stories.

The talk will also discuss our future direction, in particular how we leverage our Envoy service mesh to make tooling investments at a standard layer of the stack.
